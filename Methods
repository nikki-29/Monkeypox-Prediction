Monkeypox-Prediction
Models used for Monkeypox prediction:

1. Linear Regression 
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. 
It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.
It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

2. Decision Tree Regressor
Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous 
output. Continuous output means that the output/result is not discrete, i.e., it is not represented just by a discrete, known set of numbers or values.

3. Random Forest Regressor
A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve
the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default),
otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.
